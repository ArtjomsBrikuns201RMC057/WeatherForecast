# WeatherForecast

<b>Artjoms Brikuns, 201RMC057</b>

This project is a weather forecast application built using Python's Tkinter library for the graphical user interface. It integrates with the WeatherAPI to fetch current and forecasted weather data for various cities. Users can search for cities stored in a SQLite database, view the current weather, and switch between detailed weather information and a 7-day forecast. The app displays weather icons using the PIL library for image processing. Key features include real-time search functionality, detailed weather descriptions, and a responsive interface, making it a comprehensive tool for weather tracking.
